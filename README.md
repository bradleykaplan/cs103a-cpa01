In the Jupyter notebook I analyze B Corporation certification scores. All information is contained in that notebook.
(also used header documentation https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_markdown_cells.htm and maybe some other sources I forgot to list but I listed most sources in comments of Jupyter notebook)
